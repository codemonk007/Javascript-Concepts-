Some of important concetps 
**Template Literals**
In Es5 we had to used + and "" to separate variables and string .Es6 comes with two ways where representing and consoling variables with string is much more easy.

Ex:
```javascript

**ES5** var name = 'Your name is ' + first + ' ' + last + '.'
**ES6** var name = `Your name is ${first}  ${last}.` (inside of the **back-ticked**).
        also we can use **{{}}** to represent any variable in templates.

        Another yummy syntactic sugar is multi-line string. In ES5, we had to use one of these approaches:
        Ex:
            let test=`This is just a test
                      to test new features of Es6`
        out put preserves the space.
